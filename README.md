# Infrastructure as Code:

The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure (e.g., servers, networks, databases) using code and automation scripts.

This allows for consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled infrastructure deployments.

## How is it made:

- In IaC, configurations files are created that contain your infrastructure specifications. 
  - E.g., Terraform.
- This makes it easier to edit and distrubute configurations.
- Also ensures your provision every environment the same.
- By codifying and documenting your configuration specifications, IaC aids configuration management.
- Helps to avoid undocumented, ad-hoc configuration changes.

### Example:

A client who would like us to create two VM's on the cloud, we can have a script that does it for us. 

Any script that helps us build infrascture is IaC.

# Configuration Management:

The practice of systematically managing and maintaining the configuration (settings, parameters, and software versions) to keep IT systems and infrastructure in a desired state.

Ensure consistency, reliability, and efficient operation while allowing for changes and updates to be tracked and controlled.

# Orchestration:

- The automated coordination, configuration, and management of multiple tasks, processes, or services. 
- Helps to achieve a specific goal or workflow. 
- As servers and applications scale, so does managing all moving parts.
- The need to combine multiple automated tasks and their configurations across of groups of systems / machines increases.
