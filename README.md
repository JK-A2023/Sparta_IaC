# Infrastructure as Code:

The practice of managing and provisioning infrastructure (e.g., servers, networks, databases) using code and automation scripts, allowing for consistent, repeatable, and version-controlled infrastructure deployments.

### Example:

A client who would like us to create two VM's on the cloud, we can have a script that does it for us. 

Any script that helps us build infrascture is IaC.

# Configuration Management:

The practice of systematically managing and maintaining the configuration (settings, parameters, and software versions) of IT systems and infrastructure to ensure consistency, reliability, and efficient operation while allowing for changes and updates to be tracked and controlled.

# Orchestration:

Orchestration is the automated coordination and management of multiple tasks, processes, or services to achieve a specific goal or workflow, often in a complex and interconnected system. It involves sequencing and monitoring actions to ensure they are executed in a coordinated and efficient manner.
